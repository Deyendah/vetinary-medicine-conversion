# Vetinary Medicine Conversion Calculator
This program is being developed in two stages. 
The first will be the basic calculator function, while the second half will make
specific accomodations for certain medications that will be filled out in a database.

The first stage is simply meant to convert lbs > kgs > mgs > ml > account for concentration.
Users will be prompted for the weight metric. If lbs then the first part of the calcualtion (lbs > kgs)
is completed. If not then this step is skipped.
Next kgs > mgs proceeds uninterupted
Next the user is prompted if the medication is in mg or mls. If mls then the last part of
the calcualtion (mgs > mls) is completete. If not then this step is skipped.
The calcualtion displays the end measurement and promts the user to return to main menu.
